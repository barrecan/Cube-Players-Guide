#####Included Assets
**Mana Symbols**

Included in the *assets* folder are high-resolution .PNG/.SVG files for the 5 Magic colors, as well as a colorless icon. 

**Beleren Font**

The font used for the PowerPoint template is the beautiful *Beleren* type family. Commisioned in late 2012 by Wizards of the Coast, *Beleren* was designed by Delve Withrington for Magic: the Gathering branding. 

Following the launch of *Magic 2015 – Duels of the Planeswalkers* in July 2014, the Beleren typeface was officially placed into service as the primary display type for Magic 2015. Beleren can now be seen on game cards, in apps, product packaging and elsewhere.

The Beleren type family is comprised of nine fonts in total. Its fantastical nature integrates perfectly with the stunning, highly original art that is a perennial signature of Magic: The Gathering.

I have included the beleren-bold TrueType (.ttf) in the *assets* folder.
