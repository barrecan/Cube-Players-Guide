The font used for the PowerPoint template is the beautiful *Beleren* type family. Commisioned in late 2012 by Wizards of the Coast, *Beleren* was designed by Delve Withrington for Magic: the Gathering branding. 

The Beleren type family is comprised of nine fonts in total. Its fantastical nature integrates perfectly with the stunning, highly original art that is a perennial signature of Magic: The Gathering.

I have included the beleren-bold TrueType (.ttf) in the *assets* folder. 

If you enjoy the font, please consider support [the designer](https://delvefonts.com/).
